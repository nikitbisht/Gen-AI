# ðŸ¤– Generative AI Notes

This repository contains my personal notes, code, and experiments related to Generative AI.  
Currently, I have completed my learning in **PyTorch** and am now focusing on **LangChain** to build and use generative AI systems.

## ðŸš§ Learning Goals

- Master LangChain components (Tools, Agents, Chains)
- Understand the integration of LLMs with LangChain
- Explore LangChainâ€™s applications in building AI-powered applications
- Use prompt engineering and retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
- Continue exploring more Generative AI topics

## ðŸ§± Topics Covered (In Progress)

- **PyTorch**: Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, etc.
- **LangChain**: LangChain Components


## ðŸ“Œ Notes

This repository is a personal learning space and is continuously evolving as I dive deeper into LangChain and other Generative AI technologies.
